# `uwu` (ꈍᴗꈍ)♡

## Installation

You can install the development version of uwu like so:

This requires Rust to be installed. 

``` r
if (requireNamespace("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("josiahparry/uwu")
```



## Example

Generate v4 UUIDs ~20x faster than `uuid` 

```{r example}
library(uwu)
new_v4(10)
```

Or you can generate v7 UUIDs ~2.5x slower than `uuid` 

```{r}
new_v7(10)
```

The neat part, though, is that we can impute a UUID into a character vector by reference. This means that once the operation has occured, you cannot take it back!!

```{r}
x <- c("a", NA, "c")

# x has been imputed 
impute_uuid(x)

x
```

It can also have a prefix added to it:

```{r}
x <- c("a", NA, "c")

# x has been imputed 
impute_uuid(x, prefix = "NA_")
x
```

Here's an example to address the problem that prompted this.

```{r}
# define a data.frame with missing values 
to_impute <- data.frame(
  col_a = c("one", "two", NA),
  col_b = c("a", NA, "c"),
  col_c = c(NA, "and", "me")
)

df_names <- colnames(to_impute)

for (j in seq_along(to_impute)) {
    impute_uuid(to_impute[[j]], paste0("NA_", df_names[j], "_"))
}

to_impute
```
